At this early stage, "Shadow VRRPd" will only run on Solaris SPARC.
This should change in the near future. To compile and install the
program, simply run "make" and then copy the resulting binary to
wherever you see fit. Note that you may wish to change the default
path to the configuration file by modifying CONF in vrrpd.h.

Until I can write more detailed documentation, you only have
the included vrrpd.conf.example file for reference. However,
feel free to email me if you have any questions. I would 
appreciate hearing the results of any testing that is done.
